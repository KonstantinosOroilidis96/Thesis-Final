Geo-challenge title: Pixel Based Analysis of Multispectral Images For Measuring Weed Density in Turf grass.

Objective: The main objective of this study is to detect and classify the established weeds within turfgrass ecosystems, with pixel based classification methods from multispectral aerial (UAV) imagery.
      
      Dataset Description:
	The dataset consists of 2 multispectral ortho-mosaics of two different dates (18th of October & 20th of 	November, 2019) of 9 x 9 mm pixel resolution. Their size is 375,233 KB (18th of October) and 324,204 	KB (20th of November). In addition, the ortho-mosaic creation was made via Agisoft Metashape by 	Konstantinos Oroilidis, with the individual images being captured in 4 different bands namely, GREEN, 	RED, REG, NIR.

	Extent: 691012.5, 691067.6, 5765621, 5765677  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
	
	CRS: WGS84

	Link will be created later. We would have to upload it to dropbox or another server as they are currently 	local files.
